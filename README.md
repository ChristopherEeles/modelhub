We are building a collection of deep learning models for medical data. Check it out [here](http://www.modelhub.ai).

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety of medical applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

About us: We are the [Computational Imaging and Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://www.cibl-harvard.org/) at the Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We are a data science lab focused on the development and application of novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to various types of medical data.
