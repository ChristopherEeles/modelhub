We are building a collection of deep learning models for medical data (and beyond). Check it out [here](http://www.modelhub.ai).

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety of medical applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

This repository is the index/registry of all models, and as such the point where all developments under [modelhub-ai](https://github.com/modelhub-ai) come together. Read on to learn how to use it and how to contribute your own models.

## Quick Start

The most accessible way to experience modelhub is [via modelhub.ai](http://www.modelhub.ai). You can explore the model library, try them online, and find instructions on how to run models locally.

But since you are here, follow these steps to get modelhub running on your local computer:

1. **Install Docker** (if not already installed)
   
   Follow the [official Docker instrcutions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to install Docker CE.
   Docker is required to run models.

2. **Install Python 2.7 or 3.6 (or higher)** (if not already installed)

   Download and install Python from the official [Python page](https://www.python.org/). Modelhub requires 
   Python 2.7 or Python 3.6 (or above).
   
3. **Downlad modelhub start script**

   Download [start.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelhub-ai/modelhub/master/start.py) from this repository and place it into an empty folder. Write access is required in this folder.
