We are building a collection of deep learning models for medical data. Check it out [here](http://www.modelhub.ai).

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety of medical applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

This repository is the index/registry of all models, and as such the point where all developments under [modelhub-ai](https://github.com/modelhub-ai) come together. Read on to learn how to use it and how to contribute your own models.
